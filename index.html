      <h2 class="header">About</h2>
      <p>
        The main objective behind this project was to learn Meteor by developing something more elaborate and fun than the typical Todo app. Therefore I decided to implement a game web app that could be played through a smartphone (and any other web-enabled device, obviously), and would mainly take advantage of Meteor's amazing real-time data synchronization feature. So I chose my favorite party game for the experiment: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25821/werewolves-millers-hollow" target="_blank" title="Werewolves of Miller's Hollow">The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="italic">Meteor Werewolves</span> web app only eliminates the necessity of having the game cards physically; the flow of the game is exactly the same and the Moderator is still necessary. These are the keys to the web app:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>First and foremost, all players need to login in order to provide a username and unique identifier</li>          
          <li>The person creating the game will be the Moderator</li>
          <li>Players can join already created games by just providing an existing game code</li>
          <li>Once all players have joined the game, the roles are randomly and automatically assigned by the app</li>
          <li>Players may place their smartphone in front of them during the game</li>
          <li>The Moderator will have a special dashboard with which she will update the status of the game</li>
          <li>Player deaths will be notified through their smartphones, next revealing their identities</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="header">Play with the code</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've cloned or downloaded the repository you'll need to install Meteor on your machine, so head <a href="https://www.meteor.com/install" target="_blank" title="Install Meteor">here</a> for instructions and do so!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the necessary Meteor packages are included in the repository under the folder <span class="snippets">.meteor</span>, so you already have them in your machine. The only thing left is to install some Node.js packages by doing:<br>
        <label class="snippets block">npm install</label>
      </p>
      <p>
        You're ready to go, so let's start the engines and lift off:
